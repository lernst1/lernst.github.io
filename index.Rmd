## ðŸ§  About Me

I'm currently studying Biotechnology at Utah Valley University. I love working with data to uncover trends, communicate insights, and explore creative questions â€” from genomics to video games.

Outside of school, youâ€™ll probably find me playing board games, tending my garden, or snowboarding come winter!
